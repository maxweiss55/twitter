# Presidential and Senate Twitter Activity: Trump's First 9 Months in Office

We are in the Trump Era, which may also appropriately be called the ‘Twitter Era’.
President Trump is not the only politician who is taking advantage of the customizable, direct, public, and real-time platform.
Every Senator has an active Twitter account with hundreds-of-thousands or millions of followers. 
Trump alone, as of December 2018, has more than 50-million followers on the platform.

The language used by political elites is important in two main ways: 
1)	The way political elites talk about their beliefs and actions in public may reflect those beliefs and actions.
2)	The way political elites talk about their beliefs and actions in public cues and may influence what citizens 
    believe and how citizens act and vote.

The study investigates the language used by Senators and President Trump on Twitter during the Trump Presidency. 
The dataset that is the subject of this study was collected originally by FiveThirtyEight. 
The dataset was used originally for the study “The Worst Tweeter In Politics Isn’t Trump” 
by Oliver Roeder, Dhrumil Mehta, and Gus Wezerek.

From these original datasets, one can extract every tweet from President Trump and all Senators for the first nine months of 
Trump’s Presidential term. I am interested only in tweets starting from Trump's inauguration. 

Study of the data is split into four parts. First, I offer simple summary statistics and time-indexed histograms to give 
a sense of the nature of Senator and Trump Tweeting. Second, I investigate the differences in the language used by Senators 
and Trump by analyzing words used. Third, I have provided a sampling feature, where one can click through randomized tweets 
from the dataset for personal interest. Lastly, I use several different methods of sentiment analysis to study and compare 
the sentiments of different Senators and the President.

<b>Brief Results:</b>

The language used by Senate Democrats and Republicans is highly polarized. Democrats more often used words like “trumpcare”, “medicaid”, and “aca”, while Republicans more often used words like “obamacare”, “hearing”, and “foxnews”. Trump was found to be both more positive and more negative in his speech, likely meaning he uses more emotionally inflammatory language overall. Democratic Senators were both more negative and less positive than their Republican collegues.
